# Pointers
Pointer is a memory variable that stores a memory address.

## Pointer Declaration
* `The indirection operator (*) is also called the dereferencing operator.`
* `When the pointer is dereferenced, the indirection operator indicate that the value at that memory location storerd in the pointer is to be accesed rather than the address itself`
* `"&" is the address operator and represents the address of the variable. %u is used with the printf() for printing the address of a variable.`

1st program uses pointers to add the numbers and displays basics of pointers.[see the program](https://github.com/NamanMathur77/programming_questions/blob/master/pointers/intro_to_pointers.c)

## Pointers and Arrays
 *  `Array name by itself is an address or pointer. It points to the first element.`
 *  `Using Arrays and Pointers can be done in two ways. Either use the name of the array as the pointer or initialize another pointer to the array which would contain the base address of the array.`
