# Quick Sort

## Rules 
* `Initialize i as the starting element of the array`
* `Initialize j as the second last element of the array`
* `Initialize a pivot element as the last element of the array`
* `i moves until arr[i] is less than pivot`
* `j moves until arr[j] is greater than pivot and j>-1`
* `if i < j then swap arr[i] and arr[j] and then increment i and decrement j`
* `Repeat steps 4 to 6 till i<=j i.e. i and j cross each other`
* `Once i and j cross each other swap pivot element with arr[i]`
